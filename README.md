## Create Great Team Profiles with Ease!

This charming app helps busy devs generate team profiles so they focus on other things. Like debugging horrible errors
and such. Dependencies include inquirer, fs, and jest.

## Challenges

I had a hard time getting the html front end to generate correctly and had to fight with formatting and numerous bugs. I had 
to look up things I forgot about on the front end and relearn some things.

I would get frustrated when the html wouldn't generate properly. I watched many youtube videos for references and looked up documentation. This put me back on the right path. I'm about halfway through the bootcamp so a bout of exhaustion and ennui and procrastination set in. 

Luckily the panic of the approaching deadline gave me the final boost to do my best and turn in what I had. 

## Next Steps

We are finishing up express.js and I will get started on the new challenge for that shortly. I believe we are doing a note taking up of some sort. I like express it seems interesting, so I will be more motivated to work on it.
